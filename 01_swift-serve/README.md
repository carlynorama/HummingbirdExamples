# Swift Serve

This example started from a direct copy of https://github.com/adam-fowler/swift-web on 2025, Aug 15. 

He provides instruction on how to install it using [mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint), which is a great tool. Use it. I am going to explain first how to use it without installing it, and then how to install it by hand. 

I changed the name to be more inline with what I type in other languages. 

## While still testing

```shell
# from the directory with this readme
cd swift-serve
swift run swift-serve ../public
```

## Once mostly satisfied

```
# from the directory with this readme
cd swift-serve
swift run swift-serve ../public
```
